Welcome to the Bag of Words Model repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and code examples for implementing the bag of words model in natural language processing.

## Introduction

The Bag of Words Model is a fundamental technique in text analysis and natural language processing. It allows us to convert textual data into numerical representations, enabling various text mining and machine learning tasks.

## Contents

- `bag-of-words.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing the Bag of Words Model. It covers the theoretical concepts, step-by-step implementation, and practical examples.

- `data/`: This directory contains sample datasets for you to experiment with. It includes a collection of text documents that you can use to build your own Bag of Words representation.
