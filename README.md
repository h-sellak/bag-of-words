Welcome to the **Bag of Words Model** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and code examples for implementing the bag of words model in natural language processing.

## Introduction

The Bag of Words Model is a fundamental technique in text analysis and natural language processing. It allows to convert textual data into numerical representations, enabling various text mining and machine learning tasks.

## Contents

- `bag-of-words.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing the Bag of Words Model. It covers the theoretical concepts, step-by-step implementation, and practical examples.

- `data/`: This directory contains sample datasets for you to experiment with. It includes a collection of text documents that you can use to build your own Bag of Words representation.

- `test.py`: Python script that demonstrates the usage of the Bag of Words Model in a practical example.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Bag of Words Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/h-sellak/bag-of-words.git`

2. Navigate to the `bag-of-words` directory:

    `cd bag-of-word`
   
3. Install the required dependencies (use pip to install the necessary libraries):

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Launch the Jupyter notebook:

    `jupyter notebook bag-of-words.ipynb`

5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to learn about the Bag of Words Model, its implementation, and how to apply it to your own text data.

6. Run the `test.py` script:

    `python test.py`

The script will execute and demonstrate the functionality of the Bag of Words Model using the provided `data/documents.txt` dataset.
